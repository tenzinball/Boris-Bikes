```
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to websites I visit regularly.
I would like to see a list of bookmarks.
```

![bookmark_model](./images/bookmark model.png)

To set up the database
1. Connect to psql
2. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
3. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
4. Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
